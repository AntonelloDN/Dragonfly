Dragonfly for Grasshopper
========================================
Dragonfly allows users to model large-scale climate phenomena like urban heat island, account for variation in weather from year to year by generating AMY files, and estimate the influence of climate factors like elevation above sea level.  The Dragonfly intends to make many large-scale climate variables accessible to CAD interfaces and the other insects of [Ladybug Tools](https://github.com/ladybug-tools).

To install Dragonfly, [follow the instructions](https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly/blob/master/Installation_Instructions.MD).

Dragonfly uses the [Urban Weather Generator (UWG)](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/urbanWeatherGen) and [Ladybug (legacy version)](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Ladybug)
