Dragonfly for Grasshopper
========================================
Dragonfly allows users to import several satellite image datasets into Rhino/Grasshopper and warp climate files based on either this satellite data, urban morphology parameters, or future climate change scenarios.  The Dragonfly project intends to make many large-scale climate variables accessible to the visual scripting interface of Grasshopper as well as the 3D visualization interface of Rhino.

You need to have [Ladybug](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Ladybug) installed in order to run Dragonfly.

It is also useful to have [Honeybee](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee) installed, which makes it easier to run the Dragonfly components that export to the [Urban Weather Generator (UWG)][https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab].

So many thanks to the [Urban Microclimate Group at MIT][http://urbanmicroclimate.scripts.mit.edu/index.php] and the [Urban Weather Gnerator Project][https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab].

Special thanks is also due to the IPCC and the LANDSAT, ASTER, SRTM and GPM projects at NASA!
